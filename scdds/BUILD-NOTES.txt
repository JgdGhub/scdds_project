When you start the IntelliJ project, you will probably see error messages like "Git executable problem", that's
just related to where the IntelliJ project expects git to be installed and can be ignored, it won't stop
you building the code.  IntelliJ Community Edition 15.0.4 was used to create this projects, but earlier
versions should work equally well, it has been tested using 10.5.2 and worked fine.

Once the IntelliJ project is downloaded, the easiest thing to do is just run the tests, that will
build anything that needs building. All tests are expected to pass.

Of course, you don't have to build the code, you can just use the jar under "scdds/out/artifacts"

You can also use the ant build file scdds/build.xml ("makejar" and "runtests" targets) to build and run the code.

In fact, the IntelliJ project doesn't build the jar, the "makejar" ant target or the maven package target is the way to
build the jar.


Watch out for ScddsHttpHandler, it includes an 'obsolete' java-8 import - the code was originally targeted to java-8 for maximum compatibility,
the java-9 import is commented out, so just select the java-9 import if needed

    import sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection;
    //import java.net.HttpURLConnection;  // the java 9 import



Timing Issues In Tests
======================

It may be there are some timing issues in a few of the unit-tests. Many of the unit-tests try to verify behaviour when connections are failing, this involves creating threads to do bad things and waiting for the bad thing to take effect, it might be that on some machines differences in speed cause these kinds of tests to fail.

So far I've tested on a couple of different spec machines and the tests have been ok, but I don't have access to very many machines.
