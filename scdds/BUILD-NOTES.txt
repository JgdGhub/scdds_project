When you start the IntelliJ project, you will probably see error messages like "Git executable problem", that's
just related to where the IntelliJ project expects git to be installed and can be ignored, it won't stop
you building the code.  IntelliJ Community Edition 15.0.4 was used to create this projects, but earlier
versions should work equally well, it has been tested using 10.5.2 and worked fine.

Once the IntelliJ project is downloaded, the easiest thing to do is just run the tests, that will
build anything that needs building. All tests are expected to pass.

Of course, you don't have to build the code, you can just use the jar under "scdds/out/artifacts"

You can also use the ant build file scdds/build.xml ("makejar" and "runtests" targets) to build and run the code.

In fact, the IntelliJ project doesn't build the jar, the "makejar" ant target or the maven package target is the way to
build the jar.
